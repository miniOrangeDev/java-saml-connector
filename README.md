# Java SAML Single Sign On (SSO)Connector

miniOrange Java SAML Single Sign On (SSO) Connector acts as a SAML Service Provider which can be configured to establish the trust between the SSO connector and a SAML capable Identity Provider to securely authenticate the users into your application. The SSO connector uses the SAML protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data with the Identity Provider.

* **Single Logout** - Allows a user to logout from all server sessions established via SAML SSO by initiating the logout process once
* **Attribute Mapping** - Offers you to map the attributes from your IdP to your Java application
* **Role Mapping** - Map your Identity Provider roles to your Java application and restrict resources to specific roles
* **Multiple IDP's Supported** - Support SSO with multiple SAML Identity Providers
* **Custom Certificate** - Add your own custom X.509 Certificate for sending signed Request and verification of signed Response
* **Auto-sync IdP Configuration from metadata** - Keep your IDP SAML Configuration and Certificates updated and in sync
